<h1>Best Free Video Editing Tools in 2026 (No Watermark)</h1>
<p style="color:#666">Updated February 27, 2026 &middot; 14 min read</p>

<p>Professional video editing no longer requires expensive software. In 2026, free video editors deliver 4K export, AI-powered features, multi-track timelines, and color grading tools that would have cost hundreds of dollars just a few years ago. Whether you are creating YouTube content, TikTok shorts, corporate training videos, or cinematic projects, one of these six tools will handle the job without charging you a cent or stamping a watermark on your exports.</p>

<p>This guide compares six free video editors in detail: CapCut, DaVinci Resolve, Shotcut, Kdenlive, Clipchamp, and iMovie. Each tool targets a different type of creator, so the right choice depends on your platform, your content type, and how deep you want to go with editing features.</p>

<h2 id="why">1. Why Free Video Editors Have Gotten So Good</h2>

<p>The landscape of free video editing has shifted dramatically over the past three years. Open-source projects have matured, cloud-based editors have emerged, and companies now offer genuinely capable free tiers to attract users into their ecosystems. The result is that amateur creators in 2026 have access to tools that rival what professionals paid thousands for a decade ago.</p>

<p>Key advances driving this shift:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration everywhere.</strong> Hardware-accelerated encoding and decoding makes 4K editing smooth even on mid-range machines. Both NVIDIA NVENC and Apple Silicon hardware encoders are supported across most free editors, cutting export times by 50-80% compared to CPU-only rendering.</li>
<li><strong>AI-powered features as standard.</strong> Auto-captioning, background removal, scene detection, silence removal, and voice isolation are now included in free tools. CapCut and DaVinci Resolve lead here, but even Kdenlive has integrated OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text.</li>
<li><strong>Community-driven development.</strong> Open-source projects like Kdenlive and Shotcut receive consistent contributions from global developer communities. Kdenlive had over 200 contributors in 2025 alone, resulting in faster bug fixes and feature additions than many commercial products.</li>
<li><strong>Platform competition.</strong> CapCut (ByteDance), Clipchamp (Microsoft), and iMovie (Apple) all offer free editors as gateway products. Their business models do not depend on editor revenue, so they can offer premium features at zero cost to grow their platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Codec standardization.</strong> H.265/HEVC, AV1, and ProRes support have become widespread. Free editors can now import and export in formats that were previously locked behind paid software or patent licensing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="capcut">2. CapCut Desktop &mdash; Best for Social Media Content</h2>

<p>CapCut started as a mobile video editor in 2020 and has evolved into a full-featured desktop application that dominates short-form content creation. Developed by ByteDance (the company behind TikTok), it is purpose-built for social media workflows. The desktop app launched in 2022 and has received major updates every quarter since.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts creators. Anyone who needs template-driven editing, auto-captions, and fast turnaround on social content.
</div>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, macOS, Web (capcut.com), iOS, Android</li>
<li><strong>Max resolution:</strong> 4K at 60fps</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration:</strong> Yes (hardware encoding on export)</li>
<li><strong>AI features:</strong> Auto-captions (multi-language), background remover, text-to-speech (multiple voices), style transfer, video upscaler, AI script generator, silence removal, auto-reframe for different aspect ratios</li>
<li><strong>Watermark:</strong> None on free tier exports</li>
<li><strong>Export formats:</strong> MP4 (H.264, H.265), GIF</li>
<li><strong>Audio library:</strong> Thousands of royalty-free tracks and sound effects included</li>
<li><strong>Templates:</strong> Thousands of pre-built templates for trending formats</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Makes CapCut Stand Out</h3>

<p>Auto-captioning is CapCut's killer feature. It transcribes speech with high accuracy in over 20 languages, applies animated subtitle styles (dozens of presets), and lets you edit the text directly on the timeline. For short-form content where captions drive engagement, nothing is faster. You can go from raw footage to captioned, music-scored, transition-polished content in under 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The template system is equally powerful. Browse trending templates organized by content type (cooking, fitness, travel, product review, talking head), drop in your clips, and the template applies transitions, text animations, and timing automatically. This is not a creative shortcut for professionals, but for consistent social media output, it eliminates hours of repetitive work.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Export format limited to MP4 and GIF.</strong> No ProRes, DNxHR, or intermediate codec support. Not suitable for professional post-production pipelines that require lossless or high-bitrate intermediate files.</li>
<li><strong>Some premium assets require CapCut Pro</strong> ($7.99/month). The Pro subscription unlocks additional templates, effects, music tracks, and removes some AI feature usage caps. The core editor and export remain free.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy considerations.</strong> As a ByteDance product, CapCut's data handling follows ByteDance's privacy policy. Projects are processed locally on desktop, but cloud features and AI processing involve server communication.</li>
<li><strong>Limited multi-cam and advanced audio.</strong> No multi-camera editing. Audio mixing is basic compared to DaVinci Resolve's Fairlight or a dedicated DAW.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="davinci">3. DaVinci Resolve &mdash; Best for Professional Results</h2>

<p>DaVinci Resolve is the undisputed champion of free video editing. Used by Hollywood colorists, independent filmmakers, and YouTube creators alike, it packs professional-grade color grading (the industry standard), Fairlight audio (a full digital audio workstation), Fusion visual effects (node-based compositing), and a complete non-linear editor into one application. All free.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Serious creators who want professional results. Color grading, multi-track audio, VFX compositing, multi-cam editing, and 4K delivery with no restrictions.
</div>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux</li>
<li><strong>Max resolution:</strong> 4K (free version), 8K and beyond (Studio, $295 one-time)</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration:</strong> Yes (CUDA, OpenCL, Metal). Heavily GPU-dependent for real-time playback and effects.</li>
<li><strong>AI features (free):</strong> Magic Mask (object and people isolation), voice isolation, scene cut detection, smart reframe</li>
<li><strong>AI features (Studio only):</strong> AI noise reduction, AI face refinement, speed warp retiming, stereoscopic 3D</li>
<li><strong>Watermark:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Export formats:</strong> H.264, H.265, ProRes, DNxHR, EXR, TIFF sequences, and 20+ additional codecs</li>
<li><strong>Color science:</strong> DaVinci Wide Gamut, ACES support, HDR grading (free version supports SDR grading, HDR requires Studio)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Four Pages</h3>

<p>DaVinci Resolve organizes its interface into dedicated pages, each covering a distinct phase of post-production:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cut Page:</strong> Fast, streamlined editing for assembly and rough cuts. Source viewer, dual timeline, smart trim tools. Best for quickly assembling footage and making initial edits.</li>
<li><strong>Edit Page:</strong> Full-featured NLE with multi-track timeline, keyframing, effects, transitions, and titles. This is where most YouTube and corporate video editing happens.</li>
<li><strong>Fusion Page:</strong> Node-based visual effects and motion graphics compositing. Green screen keying, particle systems, 3D text, tracking, and procedural animation. Comparable to After Effects or Nuke for many tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Color Page:</strong> Industry-standard color grading with primary and secondary color correction, curves, qualifiers, windows, tracking, and LUT management. This page alone is worth more than many paid editors.</li>
<li><strong>Fairlight Page:</strong> Full digital audio workstation with multi-track mixing, EQ, dynamics, reverb, ADR tools, and bus routing. Professional audio post-production without leaving the application.</li>
<li><strong>Deliver Page:</strong> Export with granular control over codecs, bitrates, resolution, and rendering settings. Batch rendering and multiple output formats from a single timeline.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Steep learning curve.</strong> Resolve's depth is both its strength and its barrier. Plan for 10-20 hours of learning before you are productive. The Cut Page helps beginners, but the full power requires investment.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware hungry.</strong> Minimum 16GB RAM (32GB recommended for 4K). A dedicated GPU with at least 4GB VRAM is essential. Integrated graphics will struggle with anything beyond basic 1080p edits.</li>
<li><strong>Free version caps at 4K.</strong> The free version supports up to 4K UHD (3840x2160). For 6K, 8K, or custom resolutions above 4K, you need DaVinci Resolve Studio ($295 one-time, lifetime license with free updates).</li>
<li><strong>No 10-bit H.265 export on free version.</strong> You can grade in full color depth internally, but H.265 exports on the free version are limited to 8-bit. ProRes and DNxHR exports are unrestricted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="shotcut">4. Shotcut &mdash; Best for Format Flexibility</h2>

<p>Shotcut is a lightweight, open-source editor that prioritizes broad format support and low system requirements. Built on the MLT multimedia framework and FFmpeg, it handles virtually any video, audio, or image format without importing, transcoding, or converting. Drop files in and start editing immediately.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Editors working with mixed-format footage, low-spec hardware, quick turnaround projects, and anyone who wants a straightforward editor without bloat.
</div>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux (AppImage, Snap, Flatpak)</li>
<li><strong>Max resolution:</strong> 4K (hardware-dependent)</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration:</strong> Yes (hardware encoding via VAAPI, NVENC, QSV)</li>
<li><strong>AI features:</strong> None (Shotcut focuses on traditional editing)</li>
<li><strong>Watermark:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Export formats:</strong> Virtually any format supported by FFmpeg (hundreds of codecs)</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> GPL v3 (fully open source)</li>
<li><strong>Installer size:</strong> ~90MB (compared to 2.5GB+ for DaVinci Resolve)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Choose Shotcut</h3>

<p>Shotcut's native format support is unmatched. It reads MKV, WebM, AVI, MOV, MP4, MPEG-TS, OGG, WAV, FLAC, and dozens more without transcoding. This matters when you receive footage in mixed formats from different cameras, screen recorders, or download sources. Other editors require importing (which transcodes to an intermediate format), adding time and disk space. Shotcut simply reads the original files.</p>

<p>The filter system is Shotcut's primary effects engine. Over 100 video and audio filters cover color correction, blur, sharpen, chroma key, text overlay, stabilization, noise gate, compression, EQ, and more. Filters are applied per-clip or per-track and can be keyframed for animation. The interface is functional rather than polished, but experienced editors appreciate the directness.</p>

<p>Shotcut runs well on machines that struggle with DaVinci Resolve. 8GB RAM and integrated graphics are sufficient for 1080p editing. This makes it the best choice for older laptops, budget PCs, and Chromebooks running Linux.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>No built-in AI features.</strong> No auto-captioning, no background removal, no scene detection. You handle everything manually.</li>
<li><strong>Interface feels dated.</strong> The UI is functional but not modern. Coming from CapCut or Resolve, the lack of visual polish is noticeable.</li>
<li><strong>No built-in motion graphics.</strong> Text overlays are basic. For animated titles, lower thirds, or complex motion graphics, you need to create them externally and import.</li>
<li><strong>Limited color grading.</strong> Basic color correction filters and LUT support exist, but nothing approaching Resolve's dedicated Color page. For serious grading work, Shotcut is not the tool.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kdenlive">5. Kdenlive &mdash; Best for Linux Users</h2>

<p>Kdenlive (KDE Non-Linear Video Editor) is the most feature-rich open-source video editor with the strongest Linux support. Backed by the KDE community, it has been in active development since 2003 and provides a mature, stable editing experience with professional features and zero cost.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Linux users, open-source advocates, editors who want a traditional NLE with full control and no corporate ecosystem lock-in. Also strong on Windows and macOS.
</div>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Linux (primary), Windows, macOS</li>
<li><strong>Max resolution:</strong> No hard limit (hardware-dependent). 4K and beyond with sufficient hardware.</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration:</strong> Partial (MLT framework handles hardware encoding; timeline preview is CPU-based)</li>
<li><strong>AI features:</strong> Speech-to-text subtitles via OpenAI Whisper integration (generates SRT files), silence detection</li>
<li><strong>Watermark:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Export formats:</strong> Any format supported by FFmpeg (the entire FFmpeg codec library)</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> GPL v2+ (fully open source)</li>
<li><strong>Proxy editing:</strong> Yes (automatic proxy generation for smooth editing of large files)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Makes Kdenlive Special</h3>

<p>Proxy editing is Kdenlive's standout workflow feature. When you import large 4K or 6K files, Kdenlive automatically generates lower-resolution proxy files for smooth timeline scrubbing and editing. When you export, it switches back to the original full-resolution files. This means you can edit 4K footage smoothly on hardware that would otherwise struggle, with no quality loss in the final output.</p>

<p>The Whisper integration for speech-to-text is remarkably accurate. Kdenlive uses the open-source Whisper model locally (no cloud processing, no privacy concerns) to transcribe dialogue and generate subtitle files. You can choose model sizes from tiny (fast, less accurate) to large (slower, near-perfect accuracy for clear speech). The generated subtitles appear as editable text on your timeline.</p>

<p>Kdenlive's effects library includes over 200 video and audio effects. Color correction tools include scopes (waveform, vectorscope, histogram), curves, lift/gamma/gain, and LUT support. While not as deep as DaVinci Resolve's color page, it covers the needs of most creators.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stability on Windows and macOS.</strong> Kdenlive is most stable on Linux, its primary platform. Windows and macOS versions have improved significantly but may still encounter occasional crashes with complex projects.</li>
<li><strong>No built-in motion graphics engine.</strong> Title templates are available, but complex animated graphics require external tools like Glaxnimate (which integrates with Kdenlive for Lottie/SVG animations).</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration is limited.</strong> Timeline preview rendering is primarily CPU-based. Hardware acceleration applies mainly to encoding during export. Real-time playback of effects-heavy timelines may lag without proxy editing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="clipchamp">6. Clipchamp &mdash; Best Built-In Windows Editor</h2>

<p>Clipchamp is Microsoft's built-in video editor for Windows 11, replacing the legacy Windows Movie Maker with a modern, web-based editor. It is pre-installed on every Windows 11 machine and available as a web app on any platform. For basic to intermediate editing tasks, it requires zero downloads, zero configuration, and zero cost.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Windows users who want a built-in editor for quick projects, screen recordings, tutorials, presentations, and social media clips without installing anything.
</div>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows 11 (pre-installed), Web (clipchamp.com)</li>
<li><strong>Max resolution:</strong> 1080p (free), 4K (Microsoft 365 Personal/Family subscription)</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration:</strong> Limited (browser-based rendering)</li>
<li><strong>AI features:</strong> Text-to-speech (multiple voices and languages), auto-compose (automatic video creation from clips), AI silence removal, auto-captions</li>
<li><strong>Watermark:</strong> None on free tier</li>
<li><strong>Export formats:</strong> MP4 (H.264)</li>
<li><strong>Built-in screen recorder:</strong> Yes (screen, webcam, or both simultaneously)</li>
<li><strong>Stock library:</strong> Royalty-free video clips, images, and audio tracks included</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strengths</h3>

<p>Clipchamp's greatest strength is accessibility. It is already on your Windows 11 machine. Open it, import footage, edit, export. The interface is clean and intuitive, with a drag-and-drop timeline that anyone can understand within minutes. The built-in stock library provides b-roll footage, background music, and sound effects for creators who do not have their own media assets.</p>

<p>The screen recording feature is integrated directly into the editor. Record your screen, webcam, or both, and the recording appears on your timeline ready to edit. This makes Clipchamp excellent for tutorials, product demos, online course content, and meeting recordings.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech generates natural-sounding voiceovers in multiple languages. Select a voice, type your script, and Clipchamp generates audio that you can place on your timeline. For informational or explainer videos, this eliminates the need for microphone recording.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1080p cap on free tier.</strong> The most significant limitation. 4K export requires a Microsoft 365 subscription ($6.99/month). For social media content, 1080p is typically sufficient, but for YouTube longform or professional delivery, this is restrictive.</li>
<li><strong>MP4-only export.</strong> No ProRes, no DNxHR, no intermediate codecs. Single-format output limits professional workflow integration.</li>
<li><strong>Browser-based architecture.</strong> Performance depends on browser rendering capabilities. Complex timelines with many effects may lag, especially on lower-end hardware.</li>
<li><strong>No advanced color grading.</strong> Basic filters and adjustments only. No curves, no scopes, no secondary color correction.</li>
<li><strong>No Linux support.</strong> Windows and web only. The web version works on Linux browsers but may have feature limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="imovie">7. iMovie &mdash; Best for Mac and iPhone Users</h2>

<p>iMovie is Apple's free video editor, pre-installed on every Mac, iPhone, and iPad. It is the most polished free video editor for Apple users, offering a streamlined interface, tight hardware integration, and surprisingly capable features for a bundled application. iMovie leverages Apple Silicon's hardware acceleration for smooth editing and fast exports.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Mac, iPhone, and iPad users who want a polished, intuitive editor for personal projects, family videos, vlogs, and social content. The best entry point for beginners who will eventually graduate to Final Cut Pro.
</div>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> macOS, iOS, iPadOS (Apple exclusive)</li>
<li><strong>Max resolution:</strong> 4K at 60fps</li>
<li><strong>GPU acceleration:</strong> Yes (Metal, Apple Silicon hardware encoding/decoding)</li>
<li><strong>AI features:</strong> Smart stabilization, automatic color matching between clips, skin tone balancing, auto-enhance</li>
<li><strong>Watermark:</strong> None</li>
<li><strong>Export formats:</strong> MP4 (H.264, H.265/HEVC), ProRes (on Mac)</li>
<li><strong>iCloud integration:</strong> Start editing on iPhone, continue on Mac seamlessly</li>
<li><strong>Cinematic mode support:</strong> Edit iPhone Cinematic mode footage with depth-of-field adjustments</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Makes iMovie Special</h3>

<p>iMovie is the smoothest editing experience on Apple hardware. On an M-series Mac, 4K playback is instant, scrubbing is fluid, and exports are hardware-accelerated. The entire application feels native in a way that third-party editors cannot match because Apple optimizes iMovie directly for their chipsets.</p>

<p>The cross-device workflow is genuinely useful. Film on your iPhone, do a rough edit on the train using the iOS app, then open the same project on your Mac for detailed editing with a keyboard, mouse, and larger display. iCloud syncs the project automatically. No file transfers, no compatibility issues.</p>

<p>Magic Movie and Storyboard modes (introduced in 2022) let you create structured videos from templates. Storyboard mode provides shot-by-shot guidance for common video types (how-to, product review, cooking tutorial, Q&A), telling you exactly what to film and where each clip goes. Magic Movie automatically assembles selected clips into a polished video with music, transitions, and titles.</p>

<p>Cinematic mode editing is exclusive to iMovie and Final Cut Pro. If you shoot with iPhone's Cinematic mode, iMovie lets you adjust the depth-of-field focus point after filming, change the background blur intensity, and re-rack focus between subjects in post-production.</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple ecosystem only.</strong> No Windows, no Linux, no web version. If you work across platforms, iMovie projects are not portable.</li>
<li><strong>Two video tracks maximum.</strong> iMovie supports one primary video track and one overlay/picture-in-picture track. Complex multi-layered compositions are not possible. This is the single biggest functional limitation.</li>
<li><strong>No multi-cam editing.</strong> You cannot sync and switch between multiple camera angles within iMovie.</li>
<li><strong>Limited text and title options.</strong> Title templates are pre-designed with limited customization. You cannot create fully custom lower thirds, animated text, or motion graphics.</li>
<li><strong>No professional color grading.</strong> Color correction is limited to automatic enhancement, preset filters, and basic manual adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation). No curves, no color wheels, no scopes.</li>
<li><strong>No third-party plugin support.</strong> Unlike Final Cut Pro, iMovie does not accept third-party effects, transitions, or generators.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="choose">9. How to Pick the Right Editor for Your Workflow</h2>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 1: Define your output.</strong> Making YouTube longform? DaVinci Resolve or Kdenlive. Making TikToks and Reels? CapCut. Making tutorials on Windows? Clipchamp. Making family videos on Mac? iMovie. Working with obscure footage formats? Shotcut.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 2: Check your hardware.</strong> DaVinci Resolve needs a dedicated GPU and 16GB+ RAM for smooth 4K editing. Shotcut runs well on 8GB RAM with integrated graphics. iMovie is optimized for Apple Silicon and runs beautifully on even the base M1 MacBook Air. CapCut and Clipchamp are lightweight enough for most modern machines.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 3: Consider your OS.</strong> Linux users should default to Kdenlive or Shotcut. Windows 11 users get Clipchamp pre-installed. macOS users have all options except Clipchamp native, plus the exclusive iMovie. All platforms can run DaVinci Resolve.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 4: Test the timeline.</strong> Download your top two picks and import the same footage. The editor that feels most natural for scrubbing, cutting, and arranging is the one you will actually use consistently. Technical features matter less than a comfortable editing experience.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 5: Plan for growth.</strong> If you might need color grading, VFX, or multi-cam editing later, start with DaVinci Resolve now. If you plan to go professional on Apple hardware, start with iMovie and graduate to Final Cut Pro. Learning a complex tool early saves painful migrations later.
</div>

<h2 id="workflow">11. Editing Workflow: From Import to Export</h2>

<p>Regardless of which editor you choose, the fundamental editing workflow follows the same steps. Understanding this workflow helps you work efficiently in any tool.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 1: Organize your media.</strong> Before opening any editor, create a project folder with subfolders for raw footage, audio, graphics, and exports. Name files descriptively (scene-01-wide-shot.mp4, not IMG_4532.mp4). This organization saves hours of searching later.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 2: Import and review.</strong> Import all footage into your editor. Review every clip and mark selects (the portions you want to use). In DaVinci Resolve, use the Source Viewer to set in/out points. In CapCut, scrub through and favorite useful clips. Do not start editing until you have reviewed all footage.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 3: Assembly cut.</strong> Drag your selected clips onto the timeline in rough order. Do not worry about precision, transitions, or effects. The goal is to build the skeleton of your video: beginning, middle, end. This assembly should be 20-50% longer than your target duration.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 4: Rough cut.</strong> Tighten the assembly by removing dead air, false starts, filler words, and weak segments. Adjust clip order for better flow. Trim heads and tails of each clip. Your rough cut should be within 10-20% of target duration.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 5: Fine cut.</strong> Add transitions (use sparingly -- cuts are almost always better than wipes or dissolves). Add b-roll to cover jump cuts. Layer in background music at appropriate levels (typically -20dB to -30dB below dialogue). Add text overlays and titles.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 6: Color and audio.</strong> Apply color correction to normalize exposure and white balance across clips. Add audio effects: noise reduction, EQ to clean up voice, compression to even out levels. In DaVinci Resolve, this is where the Color and Fairlight pages shine.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Step 7: Export.</strong> Choose the right settings for your delivery platform. See the export cheat sheet below.
</div>

<h2 id="export">12. Export Settings Cheat Sheet</h2>

<table>
<tr><th>Platform</th><th>Resolution</th><th>Frame Rate</th><th>Codec</th><th>Bitrate</th></tr>
<tr><td>YouTube (1080p)</td><td>1920x1080</td><td>24/30/60fps</td><td>H.264 High</td><td>8-12 Mbps</td></tr>
<tr><td>YouTube (4K)</td><td>3840x2160</td><td>24/30/60fps</td><td>H.264/H.265</td><td>35-68 Mbps</td></tr>
<tr><td>TikTok</td><td>1080x1920</td><td>30fps</td><td>H.264</td><td>6-10 Mbps</td></tr>
<tr><td>Instagram Reels</td><td>1080x1920</td><td>30fps</td><td>H.264</td><td>6-10 Mbps</td></tr>
<tr><td>Twitter/X</td><td>1920x1080</td><td>30/60fps</td><td>H.264</td><td>5-8 Mbps</td></tr>
<tr><td>Archive/Master</td><td>Source res</td><td>Source fps</td><td>ProRes 422</td><td>Variable (high)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Always export at the highest quality your platform supports. YouTube and TikTok will re-encode your upload, so starting with a high-bitrate source ensures the best final quality after platform compression. Upload in H.264 High profile for maximum compatibility, or H.265 for smaller file sizes on platforms that support it.</p>
