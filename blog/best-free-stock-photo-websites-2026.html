<p>Stock photos should not cost money. Not in 2026. Not when there are millions of professional-quality images available for free with zero strings attached.</p>

<p>I used to pay for Shutterstock. $29 per month for 10 downloads. That is almost $350 per year for photos that look exactly like the free ones on Unsplash and Pexels. I felt like an idiot when I finally made the switch.</p>

<p>The free stock photo landscape has changed dramatically in the last few years. The quality is higher than ever. The selection is massive. And the licenses let you use photos for commercial projects without paying a cent or even giving credit (though credit is always nice).</p>

<p>This guide covers every free stock photo website worth using in 2026. I tested all of them for image quality, search functionality, download process, and licensing terms. Let us save you some money.</p>

<h2 id="why-free">Why You Should Stop Paying for Stock Photos</h2>

<p>The paid stock photo industry is built on a model that made sense in 2005 but is outdated in 2026. Here is why.</p>

<p><strong>The quality gap has closed.</strong> Five years ago, free stock photos were noticeably lower quality than paid ones. That is no longer true. Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay host images from professional photographers using the same cameras and techniques as paid stock contributors. Many photographers upload to both free and paid platforms.</p>

<p><strong>The selection is massive.</strong> Unsplash alone has over 4 million photos. Pexels has over 3 million. Pixabay has over 3 million. Combined with the other sites on this list, you have access to tens of millions of free images. Unless you need something extremely specific and niche, the free options have it.</p>

<p><strong>The licenses are business-friendly.</strong> Most free stock sites use licenses that allow commercial use, modification, and redistribution without attribution. You can use these photos on your website, in your marketing, in client projects, and on social media without paying or crediting anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Paid services still have a place.</strong> If you need exclusive photos that nobody else is using, hyper-specific niche imagery, or editorial photos of recognizable people and brands, paid services still offer value. But for 90% of stock photo needs, free is not just adequate. It is excellent.</p>

<h2 id="best-sites">The 20+ Best Free Stock Photo Websites</h2>

<h3>1. Unsplash -- Best Overall Free Stock Photo Site</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> 4+ million<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Unsplash License (free for commercial and personal use, attribution not required)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No (to download)<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Consistently the highest quality free stock photos available</p>

<p>Unsplash is the king of free stock photos. The quality is outstanding. The search is fast and accurate. The categories are well-organized. Most photos look like they belong in a magazine. The photography community that contributes to Unsplash takes it seriously, which means you get professional-grade images for free.</p>

<p>The one limitation: because Unsplash is so popular, you will see the same Unsplash photos used across many websites. For a unique look, dig deeper into the collections or combine Unsplash with other sites.</p>

<h3>2. Pexels -- Best for Variety and Video</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> 3+ million (plus free videos)<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Pexels License (free commercial use, no attribution required)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Free videos in addition to photos</p>

<p>Pexels is Unsplash's closest competitor and arguably just as good. The photo quality is excellent, the search works well, and they also offer free stock videos (which most other sites do not). If you need both photos and video clips for a project, Pexels is a one-stop shop. The diversity of subjects and styles is slightly broader than Unsplash too.</p>

<h3>3. Pixabay -- Biggest Free Media Library</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> 3+ million (plus illustrations, vectors, videos, music, sound effects)<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Pixabay Content License (free commercial use, no attribution required)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Not just photos -- also illustrations, vectors, videos, and audio</p>

<p>Pixabay has the broadest content library. Beyond photos, you get free illustrations, vector graphics, videos, music, and sound effects. The photo quality is slightly more inconsistent than Unsplash (more amateur contributions mixed in), but the volume and variety make up for it. Use the quality filters to sort by resolution.</p>

<h3>4. Burst by Shopify -- Best for E-Commerce</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands, focused on business and e-commerce<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Free for commercial use (CC0 or Shopify license)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Photos specifically shot for online stores and businesses</p>

<p>If you run an online store or e-commerce business, Burst is your secret weapon. The photos are specifically curated for business use: product photography backgrounds, lifestyle shots, team photos, and business imagery. Many photos were commissioned by Shopify specifically for their merchants. The quality is high and the business focus is unique.</p>

<h3>5. Kaboompics -- Best for Aesthetic and Lifestyle</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands, lifestyle and aesthetic focus<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Kaboompics License (free commercial use, attribution not required)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Color search and complementary color palette with each photo</p>

<p>Kaboompics stands out for two reasons. First, the photos have a cohesive aesthetic feel -- modern, clean, lifestyle-focused. Second, every photo comes with a complementary color palette. If you are designing a website or brand and want photos that match your colors, this feature is incredibly useful. All photos are taken by one photographer (Karolina), which gives the library a consistent look.</p>

<h3>6. Stocksnap.io -- Best for Daily Fresh Content</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands, updated frequently<br>
<strong>License:</strong> CC0 (public domain, free for everything)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Hundreds of new high-resolution photos added weekly</p>

<p>StockSnap adds hundreds of new photos every week. If you use stock photos regularly and get tired of seeing the same images, StockSnap keeps things fresh. The search and filtering work well, and the quality is consistently high. CC0 license means completely free for any use, no attribution needed.</p>

<h3>7. Reshot -- Best for Unique and Non-Generic Photos</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands, curated for uniqueness<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Free for commercial use, no attribution<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Intentionally non-generic, non-cheesy stock photos</p>

<p>Tired of the classic stock photo look (smiling businesspeople shaking hands in front of a whiteboard)? Reshot curates photos that look authentic and natural. The collection is smaller than the big sites but every photo feels genuine. If you want your website to look like it features real photos and not stock imagery, start here.</p>

<h3>8. Gratisography -- Best for Quirky and Creative</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Hundreds, creative and whimsical<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Free for commercial use<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Weird, creative, attention-grabbing photos you will not find anywhere else</p>

<p>Gratisography is the wild card on this list. The photos are creative, sometimes bizarre, and always eye-catching. If you need a photo that stops someone from scrolling, Gratisography has it. Not for every project, but for creative campaigns, blog posts, and social media where standing out matters, it is gold.</p>

<h3>9. Rawpixel -- Best for Design Resources</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Large collection plus design resources<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Free tier with limited daily downloads, commercial use allowed<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> Free account for some features<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> PSD mockups, vectors, and design templates alongside photos</p>

<p>Rawpixel goes beyond stock photos. They offer free PSD mockups, vector illustrations, design templates, and textures alongside their photo library. For designers who need photos plus design assets, Rawpixel is efficient because everything is in one place.</p>

<h3>10. Life of Pix -- Best for High-Resolution Landscape Photos</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands, focused on landscapes and architecture<br>
<strong>License:</strong> CC0 (public domain)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Extremely high-resolution landscape and urban photos</p>

<p>If you need stunning landscape, nature, or architecture photos, Life of Pix delivers. The resolution is exceptionally high (often 5000+ pixels wide), making these photos suitable for large prints, desktop wallpapers, and high-resolution displays. The collection is smaller but the quality per image is among the highest on any free stock site.</p>

<h3>11. Negative Space -- Best for Minimalist Photos</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands<br>
<strong>License:</strong> CC0 (public domain)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> Clean, minimalist photos that work well as backgrounds</p>

<p>Negative Space curates clean, simple photos with lots of -- you guessed it -- negative space. These are perfect for website hero images, blog post headers, and anywhere you need text overlaid on a photo. The simplicity of the compositions leaves room for your own design elements.</p>

<h3>12. Foodiesfeed -- Best for Food Photography</h3>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Thousands, exclusively food<br>
<strong>License:</strong> Free for commercial use (Foodiesfeed license)<br>
<strong>Signup required:</strong> No<br>
<strong>Standout feature:</strong> The best free food photography on the internet</p>

<p>If you need food photos, skip the general stock sites and go straight to Foodiesfeed. Every photo is food-related and the quality is restaurant-menu caliber. Fresh ingredients, plated dishes, cooking process shots, and cafe/restaurant atmosphere photos. Perfect for food blogs, restaurant websites, and cooking content.</p>

<h2 id="licenses">Understanding Photo Licenses (So You Do Not Get Sued)</h2>

<p>This is the boring but important part. Using photos with the wrong license can get you in legal trouble. Here is the simple breakdown.</p>

<h3>CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) -- Most Free</h3>
<p>The photographer gives up all rights. You can use the photo for anything. Commercial, personal, modified, unmodified, with or without credit. No restrictions. Pixabay, StockSnap, and Life of Pix use CC0.</p>

<h3>Unsplash License / Pexels License -- Nearly as Free</h3>
<p>Similar to CC0 with one restriction: you cannot compile photos from the site and create a competing stock photo service. Everything else is fair game. You can use photos commercially, modify them, and you do not need to give credit.</p>

<h3>Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) -- Free With Credit</h3>
<p>You can use the photo for anything but you must give credit to the photographer. This is common on Flickr and some other platforms. The credit does not need to be prominent -- a small text link is usually sufficient.</p>

<h3>What You Should Never Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use a photo without checking its license first</li>
<li>Assume a photo found on Google Images is free to use (most are not)</li>
<li>Use photos of recognizable people in advertising without a model release</li>
<li>Download from random "free stock photo" sites without verifying the license</li>
<li>Remove watermarks from paid stock photos (this is theft and easily detectable)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="ai-generated">Free AI-Generated Stock Photos</h2>

<p>AI-generated images have become a legitimate source of stock imagery in 2026. Here are the best free options.</p>

<h3>Lexica -- Best AI Image Search</h3>
<p>Lexica has a searchable database of millions of AI-generated images. Many are available under permissive licenses. The quality ranges from impressive to uncanny, but for certain uses (backgrounds, abstract imagery, conceptual illustrations), AI-generated images work perfectly.</p>

<h3>Generated Photos -- AI-Generated Faces</h3>
<p>Need a photo of a person but do not want to deal with model releases? Generated Photos creates photorealistic AI-generated faces of people who do not exist. Free for personal use, paid for commercial use. The faces are diverse, high-quality, and raise no privacy concerns because the people are not real.</p>

<h3>Things to Know About AI Stock Photos</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI images sometimes have subtle artifacts (extra fingers, distorted text, weird backgrounds)</li>
<li>The legal landscape around AI-generated images is still evolving</li>
<li>Some clients and companies specifically do not want AI-generated imagery</li>
<li>Always check the license -- some AI tools retain rights to generated images</li>
<li>AI images work best for backgrounds, textures, abstract concepts, and supplementary imagery rather than hero images</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="niche">Best Sites for Specific Niches</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Food:</strong> Foodiesfeed (best free food photography)</li>
<li><strong>Nature and landscapes:</strong> Life of Pix, Unsplash nature collection</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> ISO Republic, Unsplash tech collection</li>
<li><strong>Business and e-commerce:</strong> Burst by Shopify</li>
<li><strong>Minimalist and backgrounds:</strong> Negative Space</li>
<li><strong>Vintage and historical:</strong> New Old Stock</li>
<li><strong>Quirky and creative:</strong> Gratisography</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle and aesthetic:</strong> Kaboompics</li>
<li><strong>Authentic and non-generic:</strong> Reshot</li>
<li><strong>Design resources (photos + mockups):</strong> Rawpixel</li>
<li><strong>African representation:</strong> TONL, Nappy (free diverse stock photos)</li>
<li><strong>Women of color:</strong> CreateHER Stock</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="search-tips">How to Search for Stock Photos Like a Pro</h2>

<p>Finding the right photo fast is a skill. Here is how to do it.</p>

<h3>Use Specific Keywords</h3>
<p>"Office" returns generic results. "Woman working laptop coffee shop morning" returns specific, useful results. Be descriptive. Include the subject, setting, mood, and any important details.</p>

<h3>Search Multiple Sites</h3>
<p>Different photographers upload to different platforms. A photo that does not exist on Unsplash might be on Pexels. Always search at least 2-3 sites before giving up.</p>

<h3>Use Color Filters</h3>
<p>Several sites (Unsplash, Pexels, Kaboompics) let you filter by color. If your website uses blue branding, filter for blue-toned photos. This saves hours of scrolling and ensures visual consistency across your project.</p>

<h3>Browse Collections and Curations</h3>
<p>Photographers and editors create themed collections on Unsplash and Pexels. Browsing these collections often surfaces better photos than keyword searches because someone has already done the curation work.</p>

<h3>Try Reverse Image Search</h3>
<p>If you find a paid stock photo you like but want a free alternative, do a Google reverse image search. Google will show you visually similar images, some of which may be available for free on the sites listed above.</p>

<h2 id="avoid">Sites to Avoid (And Why)</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Random "free stock photo" sites you have never heard of.</strong> Some host stolen images from paid services. If you use a stolen image, you could face copyright claims even if you found it on a "free" site.</li>
<li><strong>Google Images without checking licenses.</strong> Most images on Google are copyrighted. "Finding it on Google" is not a license to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Sites that require credit card for "free trial."</strong> These are paid services masquerading as free. You will forget to cancel and get charged.</li>
<li><strong>Sites with aggressive popup ads and download buttons everywhere.</strong> Legitimate stock photo sites have clean interfaces. Sites covered in ads often bundle malware with downloads.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest as a source.</strong> Pinterest is a discovery tool, not a stock photo source. The photos on Pinterest belong to whoever uploaded them originally. Using them without permission is copyright infringement.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="optimize">How to Optimize Stock Photos for Web</h2>

<p>Downloading a 6000x4000 pixel photo and uploading it directly to your website is a common mistake. Here is how to optimize.</p>

<h3>Resize Before Uploading</h3>
<p>Most website images do not need to be more than 1920 pixels wide. Resize to the actual display size. A 6000-pixel-wide image displayed at 800 pixels wide wastes bandwidth and slows your site. Use free tools at <a href="https://spunk.codes/exclusive/">spunk.codes</a> for quick image resizing and optimization.</p>

<h3>Compress Without Visible Quality Loss</h3>
<p>Use tools like TinyPNG, Squoosh (by Google), or ImageOptim to compress photos. You can typically reduce file size by 50-80% with no visible quality difference. A 5MB photo can become a 500KB photo that looks identical on screen.</p>

<h3>Use WebP Format</h3>
<p>WebP produces smaller files than JPEG at the same quality. All modern browsers support WebP. If your CMS supports it, convert your stock photos to WebP before uploading. The file size savings are significant.</p>

<h3>Add Alt Text</h3>
<p>When you add stock photos to your website, always write descriptive alt text. This helps SEO and makes your site accessible to screen reader users. "Woman working on laptop in coffee shop" is better than "stock-photo-123.jpg" or leaving the alt text blank.</p>

<h3>Lazy Load Images</h3>
<p>If your page has multiple images, implement lazy loading so images only load when the user scrolls to them. This dramatically improves page load time. Most modern CMS platforms support this natively.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives to Stock Photos</h2>

<p>Stock photos are not your only option. Consider these alternatives too.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Take your own photos.</strong> Original photos always outperform stock photos for authenticity. Even phone photos with good lighting and composition look better than generic stock imagery. See our <a href="https://spunk.pics/blog/how-to-take-better-photos-with-your-phone-2026.html">phone photography guide</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use illustrations instead.</strong> Custom illustrations or free illustration libraries (unDraw, Humaaans) give your brand a unique look that stock photos cannot match.</li>
<li><strong>Screenshot-based graphics.</strong> For tech content, screenshots of your actual product or tool are more useful and authentic than stock photos of someone using a laptop.</li>
<li><strong>User-generated content.</strong> If you have customers or fans, ask permission to use their photos. Real customer photos build more trust than stock imagery.</li>
<li><strong>Free design tools.</strong> Create custom graphics using <a href="https://spunk.codes/exclusive/">free tools at spunk.codes</a> or Canva's free tier. A simple gradient with text can be more effective than a stock photo for certain uses.</li>
</ul>

<!-- FAQ -->
<div class="faq">
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<details open>
<summary>What is the best free stock photo website?</summary>
<p>Unsplash is the best overall for quality and selection with 4+ million professional photos. Pexels is a close second and also offers free videos. Pixabay has the largest total media library including illustrations, vectors, and audio. For specific niches, Burst (e-commerce), Foodiesfeed (food), and New Old Stock (vintage) are the best options.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Can I use free stock photos for commercial purposes?</summary>
<p>Yes, on the sites listed in this guide. Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, and most other sites featured here allow free commercial use without attribution. Always check the specific license on the site you are downloading from. CC0 and Unsplash/Pexels licenses explicitly allow commercial use.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do I need to credit the photographer on free stock photos?</summary>
<p>On CC0 and Unsplash/Pexels licensed photos, no. Attribution is appreciated but not legally required. On CC BY (Creative Commons Attribution) licensed photos, yes, you must give credit. Always check the license before using a photo. When in doubt, give credit -- it costs nothing and supports photographers.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Are free stock photos actually free or is there a catch?</summary>
<p>The sites on this list are genuinely free. No watermarks, no hidden fees, no credit card required. They sustain themselves through different models: Unsplash and Pexels drive traffic to their paid API services, Pixabay shows some ads, and Burst is funded by Shopify as a service for their merchants. The catch, if any, is that popular free photos get overused.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Can I get in legal trouble for using free stock photos?</summary>
<p>If you use photos from the reputable sites on this list following their license terms, no. Where people get in trouble: using photos found on Google Images without checking the license, using photos of recognizable people in advertising without model releases, or downloading from sketchy sites that host stolen images. Stick to the sites listed here and read the license.</p>
</details>

<summary>How do I find unique stock photos that nobody else is using?</summary>
<p>Search smaller niche sites like Reshot, Kaboompics, and Gratisography instead of Unsplash and Pexels. Browse recent uploads rather than popular or trending photos. Use specific multi-word search queries. Combine multiple stock photos in a design to create something unique. Or take your own photos -- they will always be unique.</p>

<summary>Are AI-generated stock photos safe to use?</summary>
<p>The legal landscape is evolving. For backgrounds, textures, and supplementary imagery, AI-generated photos are generally safe. For prominent use, check the specific license of the AI tool that generated the image. Some tools retain rights. The safest approach is using photos from established free stock sites with clear, proven licenses.</p>
