<h1>Best Free Stock Photo Sites in 2026</h1>
<p style="color:#666">Updated February 27, 2026 &middot; 15 min read</p>

<p>Stock photos power the internet. Every blog post, landing page, social media campaign, and marketing email needs images, and paying $10-50 per photo adds up fast. Fortunately, several sites offer millions of high-quality, free-to-use photos with generous licenses that cover commercial use.</p>

<p>This guide compares the six best free stock photo sites in 2026: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, Burst by Shopify, StockSnap, and Kaboompics. We cover library size, photo quality, license terms, search experience, and the specific use cases where each site excels.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="unsplash">1. Unsplash</h2>

<p>Unsplash is the most popular free stock photo site in the world, and for good reason. It hosts over 3.5 million high-resolution photos contributed by a global community of over 300,000 photographers. The quality floor is remarkably high because Unsplash curates submissions and features the best work prominently.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Blog posts, website hero images, social media, presentations, and any project that needs consistently beautiful, editorial-style photography.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library size:</strong> 3.5+ million photos</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> Unsplash License (custom). Free for commercial and personal use. No attribution required (but appreciated).</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> High-resolution originals, typically 4000-6000 px on the long edge</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> Nature, architecture, people, business, technology, food, travel, and 20+ more</li>
<li><strong>Search quality:</strong> Excellent. AI-powered search understands context and synonyms</li>
<li><strong>API:</strong> Free API available for developers (50 requests/hour on free tier)</li>
<li><strong>Download limits:</strong> None. Download as many photos as you want</li>
<li><strong>Account required:</strong> No (but required for collections and liking photos)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unsplash License details</h3>
<p>The Unsplash License is more permissive than Creative Commons Zero (CC0) in some ways but has specific restrictions. You can use photos for free for commercial and non-commercial purposes. You do not need to credit the photographer (though it is encouraged). However, you cannot sell unmodified Unsplash photos as prints, posters, or physical goods. You also cannot compile Unsplash photos to create a competing stock photo service.</p>

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consistently high quality across the entire library</li>
<li>Excellent search with curated collections and topics</li>
<li>Editorial-style photography that looks natural, not staged</li>
<li>Active community with fresh content added daily</li>
<li>Integrations with Figma, Canva, WordPress, Notion, and dozens of other tools</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some popular photos are overused (recognizable across many websites)</li>
<li>Limited video content (Unsplash focuses on still photography)</li>
<li>No illustrations or vector graphics</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pexels">2. Pexels</h2>

<p>Pexels is Unsplash's closest competitor, with over 3.2 million free photos and a growing video library. Pexels was acquired by Canva in 2019, and the integration shows: you can insert Pexels photos directly into Canva designs. Pexels also includes free stock videos, which Unsplash does not.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Projects that need both photos and videos from one source. Social media managers, content creators, and Canva users.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library size:</strong> 3.2+ million photos, 50,000+ videos</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> Pexels License (similar to Unsplash). Free for commercial and personal use. No attribution required.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> High-resolution originals, multiple download size options</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> People, nature, business, food, technology, textures, backgrounds, and more</li>
<li><strong>Search quality:</strong> Very good. Supports color filtering and orientation filters</li>
<li><strong>API:</strong> Free API with 200 requests/hour</li>
<li><strong>Video:</strong> Yes, free stock videos in HD and 4K</li>
<li><strong>Account required:</strong> No</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pexels License details</h3>
<p>The Pexels License mirrors Unsplash's terms. Free for all purposes, no attribution needed, but you cannot sell unmodified photos or create a competing service. One advantage: Pexels explicitly allows using photos in products for sale (like a photo on a t-shirt or mug) as long as the photo is a component of the design, not the sole product.</p>

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Combined photo and video library in one place</li>
<li>Excellent diversity in people photography</li>
<li>Color search filter (find photos by dominant color)</li>
<li>Direct Canva integration</li>
<li>Leaderboard and challenges that incentivize quality contributions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some photos overlap with Unsplash (photographers submit to both)</li>
<li>Video library is smaller than dedicated video stock sites</li>
<li>Average quality is slightly below Unsplash (less strict curation)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pixabay">3. Pixabay</h2>

<p>Pixabay is the Swiss Army knife of free stock content. It offers over 3.9 million photos, illustrations, vectors, videos, music, and sound effects. If you need multiple content types from one source, Pixabay is unmatched.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Projects that need illustrations, vectors, and music in addition to photos. Content creators who want everything from one platform.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library size:</strong> 3.9+ million items (photos, illustrations, vectors, videos, music, sound effects)</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> Pixabay Content License. Free for commercial and personal use. No attribution required.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Multiple download sizes, high-resolution originals available</li>
<li><strong>Content types:</strong> Photos, illustrations, vectors (SVG), videos, music, sound effects, GIFs</li>
<li><strong>Search quality:</strong> Good, with content type filters</li>
<li><strong>API:</strong> Free API available</li>
<li><strong>Account required:</strong> Required for full-resolution downloads</li>
</ul>

<h3>Pixabay Content License details</h3>
<p>Pixabay's license changed in 2019 from CC0 to a custom license. Content is free for commercial and personal use without attribution. Restrictions: you cannot sell unmodified content, redistribute on competing platforms, or use identifiable people in a way that implies endorsement without consent. The terms are similar to Unsplash and Pexels.</p>

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Largest variety of content types (photos, vectors, videos, audio)</li>
<li>Strong illustration and vector library</li>
<li>Music and sound effects for video projects</li>
<li>Community-driven with millions of contributors</li>
<li>Content type filters make it easy to find exactly what you need</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Photo quality is more inconsistent than Unsplash or Pexels</li>
<li>Some content feels dated or overly "stock photo"</li>
<li>Account required for full-resolution downloads (free to create)</li>
<li>Sponsored iStock results appear in search results</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="burst">4. Burst by Shopify</h2>

<p>Burst is Shopify's free stock photo platform, specifically designed for entrepreneurs and eCommerce businesses. The photo selection focuses on business, technology, lifestyle, and product-oriented imagery that works well on online stores and marketing materials.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Shopify store owners, eCommerce businesses, entrepreneurs, and anyone building a commercial website.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library size:</strong> 20,000+ photos (curated, not mass-uploaded)</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> Creative Commons Zero (CC0) and Shopify's custom license. Both allow free commercial use.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> High-resolution, optimized for web use</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> Business, technology, fashion, food, fitness, lifestyle, nature</li>
<li><strong>Search quality:</strong> Good, with business-focused collections</li>
<li><strong>Business focus:</strong> Collections organized by business type (fashion store, coffee shop, tech startup)</li>
<li><strong>Account required:</strong> No</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every photo is commercially useful (no random snapshots)</li>
<li>Business-themed collections organized by industry</li>
<li>High quality per photo (smaller but highly curated library)</li>
<li>Some photos are CC0 (true public domain, no restrictions whatsoever)</li>
<li>Blog tips and inspiration for eCommerce marketing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Much smaller library than Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay</li>
<li>Limited variety outside business and lifestyle categories</li>
<li>Fewer niche or artistic photos</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stocksnap">5. StockSnap</h2>

<p>StockSnap offers hundreds of free high-resolution photos added weekly. It is owned by the same company behind Snappa (a graphic design tool), and the photos are curated for quality. The library is smaller but consistently good.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Bloggers and marketers who want curated quality without wading through millions of results. Quick downloads with no signup.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library size:</strong> Hundreds of thousands of photos</li>
<li><strong>License:</strong> Creative Commons Zero (CC0). No attribution required, no restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> High-resolution originals</li>
<li><strong>Categories:</strong> Nature, people, business, technology, food, abstract</li>
<li><strong>Trending:</strong> Shows most downloaded and most favorited photos for discovering popular content</li>
<li><strong>Account required:</strong> No</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
<li>True CC0 license (no restrictions at all, even fewer than Unsplash)</li>
<li>Consistent quality across the library</li>
<li>Clean interface with no clutter</li>
<li>View counts and download counts help identify popular photos</li>
<li>No account or signup required for any feature</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smaller library means fewer options for niche topics</li>
<li>Search is less sophisticated than Unsplash or Pexels</li>
<li>Slower update cadence (fewer new photos per week)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kaboompics">6. Kaboompics</h2>

<p>Kaboompics is a niche free stock photo site run by photographer Karolina Grabowska. The library specializes in styled lifestyle, fashion, interior design, and flat-lay photography with a cohesive aesthetic. Every photo comes with a complementary color palette, which is unique among stock photo sites.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Bloggers, Instagram creators, and brands that need aesthetically consistent, styled photography. Interior design, fashion, beauty, and lifestyle content.
</div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Library size:</strong> 25,000+ photos</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="licenses">8. Understanding Stock Photo Licenses</h2>

<p>Not all "free" photos are equal. Understanding licenses prevents legal problems down the road.</p>

<h3>Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</h3>
<p>The most permissive license. The photographer has waived all rights. You can use, modify, and distribute the photo for any purpose, including commercial, without attribution. No restrictions whatsoever. StockSnap and some Burst photos use CC0.</p>

<h3>Custom Free Licenses (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay)</h3>
<p>These are nearly as permissive as CC0 but include specific restrictions. The common restrictions are: no reselling unmodified photos, no using photos to create a competing stock service, and no using identifiable people in misleading or offensive contexts. For 99% of use cases, these licenses are functionally identical to CC0.</p>

<h3>Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY)</h3>
<p>Some stock sites use CC BY, which requires you to credit the photographer when you use their work. The credit must include the photographer's name, the license type, and a link to the original. This is still free but requires attribution work.</p>

<h3>Editorial Use Only</h3>
<p>Some photos (especially on larger sites like Getty and Shutterstock) are marked "editorial use only." These photos contain recognizable trademarks, logos, or people who have not signed model releases. You can use them in news, commentary, and educational content but not in advertising, marketing, or product packaging. None of the six sites in this guide use "editorial only" restrictions.</p>

<h2 id="quality">9. Quality Comparison: What to Expect</h2>

<p>Not all free stock photos are created equal. Here is an honest assessment of what you will find on each platform.</p>

<h3>Resolution and technical quality</h3>
<p>All six sites offer high-resolution downloads. Unsplash and Pexels typically provide photos at 4000-6000 px on the long edge, which is more than enough for web use, social media, and most print applications. Pixabay offers multiple download sizes. Burst and Kaboompics also provide high-resolution originals.</p>

<h3>Aesthetic quality</h3>
<p>This is where the sites diverge. Unsplash has the highest average aesthetic quality because it actively curates submissions. Pexels is close behind. Kaboompics has consistent quality within its niche. Pixabay has the widest range: you will find both stunning photos and mediocre snapshots. StockSnap and Burst maintain good quality through smaller, curated libraries.</p>

<h3>Diversity and inclusion</h3>
<p>Pexels leads in diversity of people photography, with dedicated collections featuring people of different ethnicities, body types, ages, and abilities. Unsplash has improved significantly but still skews toward certain demographics. Pixabay and Burst are improving. If diverse representation matters for your project, start with Pexels.</p>

<h2 id="tips">10. Tips for Finding Better Stock Photos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Search across multiple sites.</strong> If Unsplash does not have what you need, check Pexels and Pixabay before resorting to paid options. Each site has unique contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Use specific search terms.</strong> "Happy woman working laptop coffee shop" returns better results than "business." Add context, setting, mood, and demographics to your search.</li>
<li><strong>Filter by orientation.</strong> Know your aspect ratio before searching. Use landscape for blog headers, portrait for Pinterest pins, and square for Instagram posts.</li>
<li><strong>Search by color.</strong> Pexels and Pixabay let you filter by dominant color. This is invaluable when matching photos to your brand palette.</li>
<li><strong>Check the photographer's profile.</strong> If you find one great photo, browse the photographer's other uploads. Many photographers contribute entire themed sets.</li>
<li><strong>Use collections and curated lists.</strong> Unsplash's topic pages and editorial collections surface the best content by theme. Pexels has similar curated collections.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid the first page.</strong> The most downloaded photos appear first. These are overused across thousands of websites. Scroll deeper or refine your search to find less common images.</li>
<li><strong>Edit photos to make them yours.</strong> Apply a consistent color grade, crop creatively, or add a branded overlay. This makes stock photos feel less generic and more aligned with your brand.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="avoid">11. What to Avoid with Free Stock Photos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use photos with visible trademarks without checking the license.</strong> Photos showing brand logos, product packaging, or storefronts may have trademark restrictions even if the photo itself is freely licensed.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use recognizable people in sensitive contexts.</strong> Even with a free license, using someone's likeness in association with health conditions, political views, or controversial topics can create legal issues if no model release exists.</li>
<li><strong>Do not claim you took the photo.</strong> Free licenses allow you to use photos, not to claim authorship. This matters in photography portfolios and contexts where original work is expected.</li>
<li><strong>Do not use obviously overused photos.</strong> Some stock photos appear on thousands of websites. If an image looks familiar, it probably is. Your audience notices. Search deeper or edit the photo to make it unique.</li>
<li><strong>Do not ignore file size for web.</strong> Stock photos are often 5-15 MB at full resolution. Always compress and resize before uploading to your website. Use tools like Squoosh, TinyPNG, or ShortPixel to reduce file size without visible quality loss.</li>
<li><strong>Do not hotlink.</strong> Always download the photo and host it on your own server or CDN. Hotlinking (embedding the image URL from the stock site) is unreliable and may violate terms of service.</li>
</ul>

<div class="faq" id="faq">
<h2 style="margin-top:0">FAQ</h2>
<details><summary>Can I use free stock photos for commercial purposes?</summary><p>Yes. All six sites in this guide (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay, Burst, StockSnap, and Kaboompics) allow free commercial use. You can use their photos on your business website, in marketing materials, on product packaging, and in social media ads. The main restrictions are: you cannot resell unmodified photos and you cannot create a competing stock photo service.</p></details>
<details><summary>Do I need to credit the photographer?</summary><p>No, none of the six sites in this guide require attribution for using their photos. However, all of them encourage you to credit the photographer when possible. It is good practice and supports the photographers who make free content available.</p></details>
<details><summary>Are free stock photos as good as paid ones?</summary><p>In many cases, yes. Unsplash and Pexels photos are regularly used by major publications and brands. The main advantages of paid stock (Getty, Shutterstock, Adobe Stock) are: larger libraries, more niche content, guaranteed model releases for every person in every photo, and exclusive photos that fewer competitors will use. For most projects, free stock is more than sufficient.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can I edit free stock photos?</summary><p>Yes. All six sites allow you to modify, crop, filter, composite, and otherwise edit their photos. You can combine them with other elements, add text, apply color grades, and use them as backgrounds. The only thing you cannot do is resell the photo itself without significant modification.</p></details>
<details><summary>What is the difference between Unsplash and Pexels?</summary><p>Both are excellent. Unsplash has slightly higher average photo quality and a more editorial feel. Pexels includes free videos in addition to photos, has better diversity in people photography, and integrates directly with Canva. If you only use one, Unsplash has the edge for photo quality; Pexels wins if you also need video.</p></details>
<details><summary>How do I avoid using overused stock photos?</summary><p>Skip the first page of results, which shows the most downloaded images. Use specific search terms with multiple descriptors. Filter by recent uploads to find newer content. Browse photographer profiles for themed sets that fewer people have discovered. And always edit photos (crop, color grade, overlay) to make them feel unique to your brand.</p></details>
