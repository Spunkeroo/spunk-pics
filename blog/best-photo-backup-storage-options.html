<h2 id="rule">1. The 3-2-1 Backup Rule</h2>

<p>The 3-2-1 backup rule is the gold standard for data protection, and it applies perfectly to photo storage. Here is how it works:</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>3 copies:</strong> Keep at least three copies of your photos. The original on your device, a local backup (external drive or NAS), and a cloud backup. Three copies means a single failure cannot cause data loss.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>2 different media types:</strong> Store your copies on at least two different types of storage. For example, your phone (flash storage) plus an external hard drive (magnetic storage) plus cloud (remote servers). Different media types fail differently, so using multiple types reduces the chance of simultaneous failure.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>1 offsite copy:</strong> At least one copy must be stored in a physically different location from the others. Cloud storage satisfies this requirement automatically. An offsite copy protects against fire, flood, theft, and other localized disasters that could destroy all local copies simultaneously.
</div>

<h2 id="google">2. Google Photos</h2>

<p>Google Photos is the most popular photo storage and backup service with over one billion users. It combines cloud storage with powerful AI-powered search, automatic organization, and sharing features. Google Photos is available on iOS, Android, and the web, making it platform-agnostic.</p>

<h3>Storage Plans</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free:</strong> 15GB shared across Google Photos, Gmail, and Google Drive</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="external">6. External Hard Drives</h2>

<p>External hard drives provide fast, reliable local backup at a low per-gigabyte cost. They are the best complement to cloud storage for a complete 3-2-1 backup strategy.</p>

<h3>Recommended Drives</h3>
<div class="step-box">
<strong>Portable HDD:</strong> WD My Passport or Seagate Backup Plus. 2TB for $60-70, 4TB for $90-110. USB 3.0. Compact and bus-powered (no external power needed). Best for general photo backup.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Portable SSD:</strong> Samsung T7 or SanDisk Extreme. 1TB for $80-100, 2TB for $150-180. USB 3.2 Gen2. Significantly faster than HDD (up to 1,050 MB/s vs 130 MB/s). Shock-resistant (no moving parts). Best for photographers who need fast access to working files.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Desktop HDD:</strong> WD Elements Desktop or Seagate Expansion. 8TB for $130-160, 12TB for $190-230. Requires wall power. Best for archival backup of very large photo libraries.
</div>

<h2 id="nas">7. NAS (Network Attached Storage)</h2>

<p>A NAS is a dedicated storage device that connects to your home network. It provides local storage accessible from any device (computer, phone, tablet) on your network, with optional remote access from anywhere in the world. For photographers with large libraries, a NAS is the best local storage solution.</p>

<h3>Recommended NAS Systems</h3>
<div class="step-box">
<strong>Synology DS224+ (2-bay):</strong> ~$300 for the enclosure. Add two 4TB drives (~$80 each) for 4TB usable storage in RAID 1 (mirrored -- if one drive fails, your data survives on the other). Total cost: ~$460. Synology Photos app provides Google Photos-like AI organization and mobile backup. Excellent for home users and hobbyist photographers.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Synology DS923+ (4-bay):</strong> ~$550 for the enclosure. Add four drives for up to 72TB raw storage. Best for professional photographers with extensive RAW libraries. Supports RAID 5 (one drive can fail without data loss) and RAID 6 (two drives can fail).
</div>

<h3>NAS Benefits for Photographers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Synology Photos:</strong> Free photo management software with AI face recognition, place recognition, timeline view, and album sharing. A self-hosted Google Photos alternative.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic backup:</strong> Configure your computer to back up photos automatically to the NAS using Time Machine (Mac) or built-in backup tools.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile access:</strong> Access your entire photo library from your phone anywhere in the world through Synology's QuickConnect or VPN.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud sync:</strong> Sync your NAS to cloud storage (Backblaze B2, Amazon S3, Google Drive) for offsite backup, completing the 3-2-1 strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Gigabit Ethernet provides 100-125 MB/s transfer speeds on your local network. Much faster than uploading/downloading from cloud.</li>
</ul>

</table>

<h2 id="raw">9. RAW File Storage for Photographers</h2>

<p>RAW files are significantly larger than JPEGs (25-60MB vs 3-8MB), which creates unique storage challenges. A professional photographer shooting 500 RAW files per week generates approximately 1-1.5TB of data per year.</p>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best cloud option for RAW:</strong> Amazon Photos (unlimited RAW storage for Prime members). No other service offers unlimited RAW storage at any price. Upload your entire RAW archive to Amazon Photos as a cloud backup.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best local option for RAW:</strong> A Synology NAS with RAID 1 or RAID 5. Fast local access for editing, automatic redundancy from RAID, and optional cloud sync for offsite backup. A 2-bay NAS with 8TB drives provides 8TB usable storage in RAID 1 -- enough for approximately 150,000-300,000 RAW files.
</div>

<div class="step-box">
<strong>Best hybrid strategy:</strong> Work from RAW files stored on a fast external SSD or NAS. Back up completed projects to Amazon Photos (unlimited, free with Prime). Keep a second local backup on an external hard drive stored in a different location (family member's house, office, safe deposit box).
</div>

<h2 id="strategy">10. Building Your Backup Strategy</h2>

<h3>For Casual Photographers (Under 50,000 Photos)</h3>
<div class="step-box">
<strong>Recommended setup:</strong> Google Photos (200GB plan, $2.99/month) + one external hard drive (2TB, ~$65 one-time). Google Photos handles automatic cloud backup from your phone with AI search and organization. The external drive stores a full local backup you create quarterly. Total cost: ~$36/year + $65 one-time.
</div>

<h3>For Enthusiast Photographers (50,000-200,000 Photos)</h3>
<div class="step-box">
<strong>Recommended setup:</strong> Amazon Photos (unlimited, included with Prime) + Synology DS224+ NAS (2x 4TB drives, ~$460 one-time). Amazon Photos provides unlimited cloud backup including RAW files. The NAS provides fast local access, AI-powered organization via Synology Photos, and automatic redundancy via RAID 1. Total cost: $139/year (Prime) + $460 one-time.
</div>

<h3>For Professional Photographers (200,000+ Photos, Heavy RAW)</h3>
<div class="step-box">
<strong>Recommended setup:</strong> Amazon Photos (unlimited RAW cloud backup) + Synology DS923+ NAS (4x 8TB drives in RAID 5, ~$870 total) + external SSD for working files (~$150 for 2TB). Three-copy protection: working SSD, NAS archive, and Amazon cloud. The NAS syncs to Backblaze B2 ($5/TB/month) for an additional offsite backup layer. Total cost: $139/year (Prime) + ~$60-100/year (B2) + ~$1,020 one-time.
