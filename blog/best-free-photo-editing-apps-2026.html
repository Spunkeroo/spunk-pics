<h1>Best Free Photo Editing Apps in 2026 (Phone and Desktop)</h1>
<p><em>Updated February 2026 | By the Spunk Pics team</em></p>

<p>Adobe Photoshop costs $22.99/month. Lightroom is another $9.99/month. That's almost $400 a year just to edit photos. And honestly? For most people, that's money you don't need to spend.</p>

<p>The free photo editing apps available in 2026 are genuinely incredible. Some of them rival Photoshop in features. Others are simpler but perfect for quick edits that look professional. I've been testing photo editing software for years, and the gap between free and paid has never been smaller.</p>

<p>This guide covers the best free photo editing apps for both phone and desktop. I'll tell you what each app is best at, what it can't do, and which one you should use based on what you're trying to accomplish.</p>

<h2 id="desktop">1. Best Free Desktop Photo Editors</h2>

<p>These are full-featured programs you install on your computer. They're the closest thing to Photoshop without paying for Photoshop.</p>

<h3>GIMP (Best Photoshop Alternative)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux | <strong>Cost:</strong> 100% free, open source</p>

<p>GIMP is the granddaddy of free photo editors and it's still the most powerful one. Layer support, masks, curves, levels, clone tool, healing tool, custom brushes, plugins -- it has essentially every feature Photoshop has. The learning curve is steeper than Photoshop (the interface is different), but once you get used to it, you can do professional-grade editing.</p>

<p>Best for: Photographers, designers, and anyone who needs advanced editing capabilities like compositing, detailed retouching, and batch processing.</p>

<p>The main complaint about GIMP is the interface feels dated. That's fair. But functionally, this free software does things that paid apps can't match. If you're willing to invest a few hours learning it, GIMP replaces Photoshop for 90% of tasks.</p>

<h3>darktable (Best Free Lightroom Alternative)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux | <strong>Cost:</strong> 100% free, open source</p>

<p>If you shoot in RAW and want a non-destructive workflow like Lightroom, darktable is your answer. It handles RAW processing, color correction, lens correction, noise reduction, and photo management. The module system is powerful and the results rival Lightroom.</p>

<p>Best for: Photographers who shoot in RAW and want a catalog-based workflow for organizing and editing large collections of photos.</p>

<h3>RawTherapee (Best Free RAW Processor)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux | <strong>Cost:</strong> 100% free, open source</p>

<p>RawTherapee is laser-focused on RAW processing and it's exceptional at it. The demosaicing algorithms, noise reduction, and color science are among the best available -- free or paid. It doesn't try to be a photo manager or a layer-based editor. It does one thing and does it extremely well.</p>

<p>Best for: Photographers who want the absolute best RAW conversion quality and don't mind a more technical interface.</p>

<h3>Photopea (Photoshop in a Browser)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Any browser | <strong>Cost:</strong> Free (ad-supported) or $5/month for ad-free</p>

<p>Photopea deserves a spot in the desktop section because it's essentially Photoshop in your browser. It opens PSD files, supports layers, has most of Photoshop's tools, and even has a similar keyboard shortcuts. The fact that this runs in a browser for free is mind-blowing.</p>

<p>Best for: Anyone who needs Photoshop-like features without installing anything. Great for quick edits on any computer.</p>

<h2 id="phone">2. Best Free Phone Photo Editors</h2>

<h3>Snapseed (Best Overall Mobile Editor)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android | <strong>Cost:</strong> 100% free, no ads, no in-app purchases</p>

<p>Made by Google, Snapseed is the best free mobile photo editor. Full stop. It has professional-grade tools: selective editing (adjust specific areas of your photo), curves, HSL adjustments, healing tool, perspective correction, and a fantastic HDR effect. There are no ads, no watermarks, no premium tier. Everything is free.</p>

<p>The "Looks" feature gives you high-quality presets as a starting point, and you can save your own edits as custom presets. The selective editing tool alone makes this app worth having -- tap on any area of the photo and adjust brightness, contrast, or saturation just for that spot.</p>

<h3>Adobe Lightroom Mobile (Best Free RAW Editor)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android | <strong>Cost:</strong> Free with limitations (some features require subscription)</p>

<p>Lightroom Mobile's free tier is more generous than most people realize. You get the full camera app (which shoots RAW), basic editing tools, curves, color mixer, presets, and healing brush. The paid features you miss are selective edits, geometry correction, and cloud sync. For most casual photographers, the free tier is plenty.</p>

<p>The built-in camera is arguably the best feature. It shoots RAW photos on your phone, giving you way more flexibility in editing than regular phone JPEGs.</p>

<h3>Google Photos (Best for Quick Edits)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android, Web | <strong>Cost:</strong> Free (15GB storage, shared with Gmail and Drive)</p>

<p>Google Photos isn't just for storage. The built-in editor has gotten really good. Auto-enhance with one tap, manual adjustments for light, color, and detail, plus AI-powered tools like Magic Eraser (removes unwanted objects) and Portrait Light (adds studio-style lighting after the fact).</p>

<p>Best for: People who want quick, easy edits without learning a new app. If your photos live in Google Photos already, the editing tools are right there.</p>

<h3>VSCO (Best Free Filters)</h3>

<p><strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android | <strong>Cost:</strong> Free with 10+ presets and basic editing tools. Membership for more.</p>

<p>VSCO's free presets are some of the most aesthetically pleasing filters available. They give photos a film-like quality that's more natural than Instagram filters. The basic editing tools (exposure, contrast, temperature, grain) are solid too. The free tier is limited compared to the paid membership, but the free presets alone are worth downloading the app.</p>

<div class="cta-box">
<h3>Free Creative Tools and Resources</h3>
<p>Photo editors, design tools, and more -- all free at spunk.codes.</p>
<a href="https://spunk.codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visit spunk.codes</a>
</div>

<h2 id="browser">3. Best Free Browser-Based Editors</h2>

<p>No downloads required. Open your browser and start editing.</p>

<h3>Photopea (Already Mentioned -- That Good)</h3>
<p>Opens PSDs, supports layers, has nearly all of Photoshop's tools. Use it at photopea.com. If you've ever used Photoshop, you'll feel right at home.</p>

<h3>Pixlr X and Pixlr E</h3>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free (ad-supported) or $5/month for premium</p>

<p>Pixlr offers two browser editors: Pixlr X (simplified, quick edits) and Pixlr E (advanced, layer-based). Pixlr X is perfect for non-technical users who want to crop, filter, and adjust photos quickly. Pixlr E is for more serious editing with layers, masks, and advanced tools. Both are free to use.</p>

<h3>Canva Photo Editor</h3>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Free tier available</p>

<p>Canva is primarily a design tool, but its photo editing features are solid. One-tap enhance, background removal (free!), filters, and easy text overlays. Best for: people who want to edit a photo and immediately use it in a social media post, presentation, or design project.</p>

<h2 id="ai">4. Best Free AI Photo Tools</h2>

<p>AI tools have changed photo editing dramatically in the past two years. Here are the best free ones.</p>

<h3>Remove.bg (Background Removal)</h3>
<p>Removes photo backgrounds instantly with AI. The free version gives you lower-resolution results (fine for social media), while the paid version provides full resolution. For Instagram posts and profile pictures, the free version works great.</p>

<h3>Upscayl (AI Image Upscaling)</h3>
<p><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows, Mac, Linux | <strong>Cost:</strong> 100% free, open source</p>
<p>Upscayl uses AI to increase the resolution of your photos without making them blurry. Turn a low-res phone photo into something you can print at poster size. It's open source, runs locally (your photos stay on your computer), and the results are impressive.</p>

<h3>Cleanup.pictures (Object Removal)</h3>
<p>Upload a photo, brush over the thing you want to remove, and AI fills in the background. Free for standard resolution. Perfect for removing photobombers, power lines, trash cans, or anything else ruining an otherwise great shot.</p>

<h3>Google Photos Magic Eraser</h3>
<p>Google's AI-powered object removal tool built into Google Photos. It automatically suggests distracting objects to remove, or you can manually brush over anything you want gone. Available free on Google Pixel phones and through Google One subscriptions.</p>

<h2 id="specific">5. Best App for Specific Tasks</h2>

<p>Here's a quick reference for specific editing needs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quick social media edits:</strong> Snapseed or Google Photos</li>
<li><strong>Professional retouching:</strong> GIMP or Photopea</li>
<li><strong>RAW photo processing:</strong> darktable or RawTherapee</li>
<li><strong>Film-style filters:</strong> VSCO</li>
<li><strong>Background removal:</strong> Remove.bg or Canva</li>
<li><strong>Object removal:</strong> Cleanup.pictures or Google Photos Magic Eraser</li>
<li><strong>Image upscaling:</strong> Upscayl</li>
<li><strong>Batch editing:</strong> darktable or GIMP with scripts</li>
<li><strong>Collages:</strong> Canva or Google Photos</li>
<li><strong>Photo to design (adding text, graphics):</strong> Canva</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="workflow">6. The Free Photo Editing Workflow</h2>

<p>Here's my recommended workflow using only free tools. This is what I use for 90% of my photos.</p>

<h3>For Casual Photos (Social Media, Sharing)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Import to Snapseed or Google Photos</li>
<li>Auto-enhance as a starting point</li>
<li>Fine-tune exposure and white balance</li>
<li>Apply a subtle filter/look if desired</li>
<li>Crop and straighten</li>
<li>Export and share</li>
</ol>

<h3>For Serious Photography</h3>
<ol>
<li>Shoot in RAW (use Lightroom Mobile's free camera or your camera's RAW mode)</li>
<li>Import to darktable or RawTherapee for RAW processing</li>
<li>Adjust white balance, exposure, highlights, shadows</li>
<li>Apply lens corrections and chromatic aberration fixes</li>
<li>Export as TIFF or high-quality JPEG</li>
<li>If needed, open in GIMP or Photopea for retouching, compositing, or advanced edits</li>
<li>Final export for web (optimized JPEG) or print (TIFF/PNG)</li>
</ol>

<p>This workflow costs exactly $0 and produces results indistinguishable from the Lightroom + Photoshop workflow that costs $396/year.</p>

<p>To get the most out of your editing, especially for serious work, consider investing in a properly calibrated monitor. A good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=color+accurate+monitor+for+photo+editing&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">color-accurate monitor for photo editing</a> ensures your edits look right on every device.</p>

<h2 id="tips">7. Editing Tips That Make Any Photo Better</h2>

<p>These tips work in any app and instantly improve 90% of photos.</p>

<p><strong>Straighten the horizon.</strong> A crooked horizon is the most common problem in amateur photos. Every app has a straighten/rotate tool. Use it.</p>

<p><strong>Brighten shadows, lower highlights.</strong> This one trick adds depth and detail to almost any photo. Pull the shadows slider up and the highlights slider down. You'll see details in dark areas and recover blown-out bright areas.</p>

<p><strong>Warm up slightly.</strong> Most phone photos look slightly cold/blue. Adding a touch of warmth (move the temperature slider toward yellow) makes photos look more inviting and natural.</p>

<p><strong>Add a tiny amount of clarity or structure.</strong> This enhances mid-tone contrast and makes photos look sharper and more defined. Don't overdo it -- a little goes a long way. Too much clarity makes photos look crunchy and overprocessed.</p>

<p><strong>Crop with intention.</strong> The rule of thirds works: place your subject along the grid lines, not dead center. Also crop out distracting elements at the edges of your frame.</p>

<p><strong>Don't over-saturate.</strong> The saturation slider is the most abused tool in photo editing. Slightly desaturated photos often look more professional than hyper-saturated ones. Try the vibrance slider instead -- it boosts muted colors without making already-saturated colors look clownish.</p>

<p><strong>Edit on a calibrated screen.</strong> Your phone screen and your laptop screen might show colors differently. Do your final check on whatever device your audience will use (usually a phone). If a photo looks good on your phone screen, it'll look good to most people.</p>

<h2 id="storage">8. Free Photo Storage Options</h2>

<p>Editing is only half the battle. You need somewhere to store your photos for free.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Google Photos:</strong> 15GB free (shared with Gmail and Drive). Compresses photos slightly on the free tier but quality is very good.</li>
<li><strong>iCloud:</strong> 5GB free. Small, but fine for your best photos if you're on Apple.</li>
<li><strong>Flickr:</strong> 1,000 photos free, at original quality. Great for photographers who want to showcase work.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon Photos:</strong> Unlimited photo storage for Prime members. If you have Prime, this is the best deal in photo storage.</li>
<li><strong>Mega:</strong> 20GB free cloud storage. Not specifically for photos, but generous.</li>
</ul>

<p>For long-term storage of your best photos, nothing beats a local backup. An <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=external+hard+drive+for+photos&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">external hard drive</a> gives you terabytes of storage with no monthly fees.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<details>
<summary>Can free photo editors really replace Photoshop?</summary>
<p>For most people, yes. GIMP and Photopea cover 90%+ of what Photoshop does. The areas where Photoshop still leads: content-aware fill (though AI tools are closing this gap), some advanced compositing features, and integration with other Adobe products. If you're a professional designer who needs specific Photoshop features for client work, you might need the paid version. But for photography, personal projects, and most professional editing, free tools absolutely get the job done.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the single best free photo editing app?</summary>
<p>For phones: Snapseed. It's free, ad-free, and has professional-grade tools that are intuitive to use. For desktop: GIMP for advanced editing, darktable for RAW workflow. For browser: Photopea. If I could only have one, it would be Snapseed on my phone -- it handles 80% of my editing needs and I always have my phone with me.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do free photo editors put watermarks on your photos?</summary>
<p>The apps on this list do not. GIMP, darktable, Snapseed, RawTherapee, and Google Photos never add watermarks. Some other free apps do add watermarks to exports -- that's why they didn't make this list. Always do a test export before editing an important photo to make sure there's no watermark or quality degradation.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Are free photo editing apps safe to download?</summary>
<p>The apps on this list are all safe. GIMP, darktable, and RawTherapee are open-source projects with transparent code that anyone can audit. Snapseed is made by Google. Photopea runs in your browser so there's nothing to download. Always download from official websites or official app stores -- never from random third-party download sites that might bundle malware.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I edit RAW photos for free?</summary>
<p>Absolutely. darktable and RawTherapee are full-featured RAW processors that rival Lightroom. Adobe Lightroom Mobile's free tier also handles RAW files. GIMP can open RAW files through a plugin. The quality of free RAW processing has improved dramatically and there's no longer a compelling reason to pay for Lightroom just for RAW support.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the best free app for editing photos for Instagram?</summary>
<p>Snapseed for detailed edits, VSCO for film-style filters, or Google Photos for quick one-tap enhancements. For adding text and graphics to Instagram stories and posts, Canva is unbeatable. A typical Instagram workflow: edit the photo in Snapseed, then add text or design elements in Canva if needed.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do free apps make money if they're free?</summary>
<p>Different models: GIMP, darktable, and RawTherapee are open-source volunteer projects funded by donations. Snapseed is funded by Google (drives engagement with their ecosystem). Photopea and Pixlr show ads on the free tier and offer ad-free premium subscriptions. VSCO has a freemium model with a paid membership for extra features. Canva is freemium with a very capable free tier.</p>
</details>
</div>

<h2>Stop Paying, Start Editing</h2>

<p>You genuinely do not need to pay for photo editing software in 2026. Whether you're editing casual phone photos, processing RAW files from a DSLR, or doing advanced compositing and retouching, there's a free tool that does the job.</p>

<p>Start with Snapseed on your phone for everyday edits. When you need more power, move to GIMP or Photopea on desktop. If you shoot RAW, add darktable to your toolkit. Together, these free tools give you a complete photo editing workflow that costs nothing and produces professional results.</p>

<p>The $400/year you save on Adobe subscriptions? Spend it on experiences worth photographing instead.</p>
